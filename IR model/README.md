### Evaluation Of IR Models:
* The goal is to implement various IR models, evaluate the IR system and improve the search results based on the understanding of the models, the implementation and the evaluation.
*	It involves the implementation of IR models such as BM25(Best Matching) model, DFR (Divergence from Randomness) models and Language model based on Solr using twitter data.
* The results obtained from each of these models is taken for Trec Eval, where the results are compared against the ground truth judgement values given by experts. 
* The MAP(Mean Average Precision) value, from Trec-eval is used for comparing the performance of the models.
* To improve the performance of the IR model, Extended query parser(edismax) and query boosting is used.
